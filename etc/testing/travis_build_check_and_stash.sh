# Travis doesn't reliably give us the right version of the code in PR builds.
#
# Sometimes it's too old (the GitHub merge ref API can be out of date) and so
# we get code from a previous commit in the pull request.
#
# Sometimes it's too new (a new commit was pushed to the PR before we ran, and
# GitHub updated the merge ref API already).
#
# We know that we are trying to test code in a merge preview with
# $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SHA on the RHS of the merge though, that information is
# reliable at least.
#
# So, try a few times to fetch and identify a valid version of the code. If we
# time out, give up. If we succeed, stash that code in a docker image which
# later tests can use to get it back.
